 * Serve cached pages and store rendered ones.

 * The control plane that drives it is NOT here — it is a real route
 * (`src/pages/tds/cache/[action].ts`), because Astro never runs middleware for
 * a path no route matches. See that file.
 *
 * ### In production Apache usually answers first
 *
 * `public/.htaccess` serves an existing cache entry straight off disk, so a
 * hit normally never reaches Node at all — that is the point of the design.
 * The hit path here still matters: it is what `npm run dev`, `npm start` and
 * any host without the rewrite use, and having both read the same store keeps
 * the two implementations honest.

/**
 * Refuse to STORE a page that was rendered while the API rejected our site key.
 *
 * `siteKeyGuard()` in `astro.config.mjs` covers the build, and it cannot cover
 * this: every content fetch is deliberately fail-soft, so at request time a
 * rejected key produces a perfectly valid page full of baked fallbacks. Cached,
 * that page would outlive the misconfiguration and there would be nothing to
 * see — a site quietly serving its own placeholder copy is exactly the failure
 * the build-time guard exists to prevent.
 *
 * Comparing the rejection counter around the render is enough. Two requests
 * racing can only make this refuse to store a page that was fine; it can never
 * make it store one that was not, and a needless miss costs one render.

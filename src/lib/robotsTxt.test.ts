 * `public/robots.txt` is served verbatim — nothing but this test reads it
 * before a crawler does.
 *
 * Until 2026-10-02 this file was eight lines and named no AI agent at all,
 * while the marketing site and the journal both did. Nothing was broken and
 * nothing reported it: the tools site simply was not in those engines'
 * answers, which is the whole ranking case for a site built on tool queries.
 *
 * Two rules. The search and fetch agents behind AI answers (OpenAI, Anthropic,
 * Perplexity, Google, Apple, Meta AI, DuckDuckGo, Mistral) are allowed by
 * name: blocking one takes the site out of that engine's answers, and no
 * report anywhere would say so. Googlebot and Bingbot — which also feed AI
 * Overviews, Copilot and ChatGPT search — fall under `*`. And every path in
 * `CLOSED_PATHS` is disallowed in EVERY group, because a crawler obeys only
 * the group that names it.

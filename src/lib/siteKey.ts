/**
 * The site key this build presents to the API.
 *
 * A site key is issued in the admin portal (*Einstellungen →
 * Site-Verbindungen*) and identifies this site to the composed API. It is
 * optional: with no key the build behaves exactly as it always has, and the
 * public read routes stay open unless an admin has switched enforcement on.
 *
 * ### `process.env`, not `import.meta.env`
 *
 * Astro/Vite inline **only** `PUBLIC_`-prefixed variables into
 * `import.meta.env`, and this repo declares no `envField` schema — so
 * `import.meta.env.TDS_SITE_KEY` would be `undefined` in every build, forever,
 * with nothing to say so. That is exactly how `TOOLS_REGISTRY_TOKEN` spent its
 * entire life: the guard that read it was unconditionally true and the sync it
 * guarded never ran once.
 *
 * A `PUBLIC_` name is not the fix. These fetches run at build time in Node, so
 * `process.env` is real here — and a `PUBLIC_` variable would be inlined into
 * the shipped bundle, i.e. the credential would be published.
 *
 * ### A rejected key must break the build — and a `throw` here does NOT do that
 *
 * Every content fetch on this site is deliberately fail-soft: the call sites
 * wrap everything in `try/catch`, warn, and return the baked fallback. That is
 * right for an API hiccup and catastrophic for a wrong key — the site would
 * silently serve stale content and the deploy would report success.
 *
 * The first attempt at this threw from {@link assertKeyAccepted} and was
 * **swallowed by those very catch blocks**: a real build against a stub that
 * answers 401 printed the "the build stops here" message five times and then
 * completed, green. Nothing in a source-scanning test could see it.
 *
 * So the throw is only the diagnostic — it aborts that one fetch and puts the
 * reason in the log. The guarantee is {@link siteKeyRejections}, recorded here
 * and read by the `siteKeyGuard()` Astro integration in `astro.config.mjs`,
 * which fails the build in `astro:build:done`. No `catch` anywhere can reach
 * that, including one somebody adds later.

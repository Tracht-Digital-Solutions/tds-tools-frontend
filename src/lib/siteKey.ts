 * Request-time protection for paired API reads — tds-shared's guard, bound to

 * The private key is loaded dynamically from the server-side connection file.
 * `connection.ts` retains `TDS_SITE_KEY` only as a one-release host fallback;
 * builds and GitHub workflows no longer receive it.
 *
 * Every public site used to keep a byte-identical copy of the guard (only this
 * label differed). `assertKeyAccepted` counts a 401/403 on `globalThis` before
 * it throws; `src/middleware.ts` refuses to store a render that grew the count.
